To Create a github page:
you must clone an existing repository, then create and index.html file and format it however you like, after that push it to the repository--make this repository public, and go the settings -> pages -> select the branch you want to be a github page -> save, now you can open your github page
I realized that making a portfolio is not an easy thing to do and also I realized that I dont have much projects to showcase. I need some personal projects to work on.
